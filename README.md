Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/FlatlineDix/thinkpad-mods/wiki) for this repo!

We are looking for thinkpad specific scripts, links to modifications, modification ideas, and other things. I'd like to have a large sample size of benchmarks of various models, high resolution photographs of chassis, motherboards, etc... and when I get the time I might make 3d models via photogammetry. 

The goal in terms of mods will be to host the material ourselves so it doesn't disappear from the internet, there are a few ideas on how to do that, including making the main branch a statically compiled Jekyll github webpage and having other branches for the scripts, high resolution photographs, benchmark data, et cetera...

Anyone can help the project, don't hesitate to contact/participate!

*Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/FlatlineDix/thinkpad-mods/wiki) for this repo, it is more up to date, but here is a copy of the most recent mods we have linked:*

[Thinkpad speaker upgrade - X230 defaults modded with Nexus 6p speakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/5wmmc6/lenovo_x230_speaker_upgrade/) - u/chairWithShoes on r/thinkpad, _mod suggested by someone whose name I forget on ##ibmthinkpad_ ; this mod is applicable to many Thinkpad models as the inserts for the speakers in most chassis are roomy enough to support different speakers.

[xiphmont's thinkpad LCD modding & blog - LP130QP1 LG 13.0" 3000x2000 along with other LCD mods](https://xiphmont.dreamwidth.org/tag/thinkpad) - thanks to b1ackop to bringing this to my attention; xiphmont's blog seems to have suffered server crash as the images don't seem to load. xiphmont also works for the Xiph.org group. Going to contact him and see if he can try to fix his blog's images...
